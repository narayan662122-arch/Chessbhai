# Build Options

Your source code has been fixed for compatibility. Choose the option that works best for your build environment:

## Option 1: Keep API 34 (Recommended for your Colab script)
Your Colab script already installs Android API 34, so this should work perfectly.

**Requirements:**
- Android SDK Platform 34 must be installed
- Your Colab script handles this: `sdkmanager "platforms;android-34"`

**Status:** ✅ Already configured in ChessChatApp_FIXED.zip

---

## Option 2: Use API 33 (For environments without API 34)
If building in an environment that only has API 33, use this version.

**Changes needed in `app/build.gradle`:**
```gradle
compileSdk 33
targetSdk 33
```

**Status:** Alternative version available in ChessChatApp_FIXED_API33.zip

---

## Compatibility Fixes Applied (Both Options)
1. ✅ Updated Java version from 1.8 to 17 (required for AGP 8.2.0)
2. ✅ Removed deprecated `package` attribute from AndroidManifest.xml
3. ✅ Build configuration compatible with Gradle 8.2 + AGP 8.2.0

**Your app functionality is 100% unchanged!**
